        <h2>Book Review</h2>
   <p>Going from zero to one means going from nothing to something. This is the greatest leap possible — greater than going from one to 10 or even from one to 100. To go from zero to one is to conjure something into existence from the dark void of oblivion. This is the essence of true innovation.

    In Zero to One, Peter Thiel draws on his experience at PayPal and Palantir to offer ideas and suggestions for technology startups. Unlocking the power of innovation is the primary goal. In order to reach this goal, the entrepreneur will need to question conventional wisdom, embrace monopoly and capture value for their new enterprise.
    
    A character as well known and controversial as Peter Thiel is at something of a disadvantage as an author. As much as some readers may admire him, others probably do not. The reader shouldn’t allow any such baggage to keep them from reading Zero to One. Taken on its own merits, the book is a well-written, thought-provoking read. The reader should maintain an open mind and evaluate Thiel’s opus critically. Intellectual honesty is challenging, but it can bring the greatest rewards. This book is likely to challenge anyone’s opinions, no matter where they may fall on the political spectrum. Groundbreaking ideas have a way of doing that.
    
    One example of Thiel’s unique reasoning is his enthusiastic embrace of monopoly. Thiel demonstrates not only his ability to come at an old topic from a new direction, but also a fearless ability to speak heresy. Competition, he explains, is not the social good we were all taught that it was in econ 101. It results in anti-social behavior and squelches innovation. Monopoly, on the other hand, has the potential for positive effects. When a company knows it can earn a termed monopoly via patents and similar methods, the firm is motivated to invent new technology, which benefits society. He is quick to state that monopolies can be misused by the greedy, but he doesn’t linger on this point. No safeguards to protect society are considered or recommended. Theil seems to be too busy making his core argument to be sidetracked by such considerations.
    
    Again, the flaws in this book shouldn’t stop anyone from reading it, as long as they remain alert to the problems. Consider it an opportunity to exercise critical thought. For the most part, this work offers solid advice for the entrepreneur and an intriguing peek into the mind of a truly unique thinker. It is sure to stimulate new ideas in entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs alike.</p>
