        <h2>Book Review</h2>
   <p>Sherlock Holmes is the world's only consulting detective. Money and prestige don't interest him, simply the chance to flex his intellectual muscles and practise his unique method of deduction are enough. Following him through a series of problems, you are able to watch a great mind at work and delve into the criminal world of London.

    I loved the Sherlock Holmes books and really enjoyed following the various mysteries that Watson and Holmes dealt with through the years. I fancy myself better at reaching the correct conclusion than Dr Watson is, although I am nowhere near as observant as Holmes.
    
    I liked the range of problems: from the oddly eccentric, with a society for men with bright red hair to the boringly mundane that turned out to be something much more malicious. And with others like a lost hat leading to the case of a stolen jewel, every story of both Holmes' triumphs and failures was highly entertaining.
    
    However, I would have liked to know more about what went on between Holmes and Moriarty. Doyle writes that they were sparring and the problems faced had been numerous and difficult, but doesn't go into details.
    
    I would recommend his books to anyone who enjoys mystery and adventure and any budding sleuths.</p>
